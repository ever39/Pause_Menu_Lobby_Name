# QuickMenuLobbyName

do you hate forgetting the name of the lobby you were JUST in? yeah, me too. so i made this mod!
what does it do? it adds a teeny tiny text to the bottom of your pause menu that displays the name of the lobby that you are currently in!!
the mod can also copy the lobby's name when you disconnect (great for when you crash)!
this is the github page though so i can't really say more, i have to get the readme from the thunderstore page of the mod but it's down at the time of writing this readme file so we'll have to wait
